Using randomForest to differentiate between fictional authors

This was an experiment to see if I could tell the difference between two fictional authors created by the same novelist based only on common stop words, e.g., "the." 
It worked, sort of. The randomForest model correctly selected Nick 97% of the time and Amy 78%.
