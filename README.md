Using randomForest to differentiate between fictional authors

This was an experiment to see if I could train a model to tell the difference between two fictional authors created by the same novelist based only on the frequency of common stop words, e.g., "the." 
It worked: The randomForest model correctly selected Nick 93% of the time and Amy 91%.
